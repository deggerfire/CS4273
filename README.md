# Project FEAR

Flaming Eagle Acrobatic Raptor

# Installing info

# Information for the fall 2024 group

## Getting setup

The project uses the R language and shiny. 

## Tabs

### Nameing

Most of the tabs are the dataset turned into a three letter id so call for service is called CFS in the code.

### UOF and CI tabs

These two tabs do not follow the normal layout for the tabs (code wise) and should be updated to matach the CFS tab.

## Group A/L split

There was two groups working on this project and so a lot of the code was divided into group A and group L stuff just to keep work area seprate.
